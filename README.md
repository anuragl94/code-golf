# Code Golf

The rules are simple. Write the smallest solution possible for each given problem statement. You may use either Python or Javascript.

There is a `README.md` file for each "Match". Your submissions should be committed to the `/submissions` folder within the respective match folder. The naming convention for your minified submission file is `<username>.min.js` (or `.min.py`), where `<username>` is the part of your email address before the `@` symbol. For example, if your email is `user@example.com`, your file should be named `user.min.js`.

To create a submission, open a pull request to the `main` branch following this convention:
1. Add a `*.js` or `*.py` file with readable code, preferably with comments.
2. Add a `*.min.js` or `*.min.py` file with minified code, which will be considered to be the actual submission.
3. Your function should be named `solution`. This is important, otherwise your submission will fail.
4. If you're updating your existing submission, update the same file instead of introducing a new one.
